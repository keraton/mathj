{"name":"Mathj","tagline":"Math using object perspective","body":"### What is MathJ ?\r\nMathJ is my personal fun projects. It tries to describe Math using object perspective. What is object perspective anyway ? For me it is simple : instead of calculating x = 1 + y, we define w,1 and y as a function and the calculation is x.set((1).add(y)). So everything is object.\r\n\r\nThe code included a String parser that can read a string expression into a mathematical function. You can try it in : [http://blackboardcmd.appspot.com/](http://blackboardcmd.appspot.com/) and type mathj.\r\n\r\n### What is next ?\r\nThe code has a potential to be build into full complete Math calculation library. But I see another potential in functional programming. Since it is math then the more natural way to build is using functional way. I'm thinking of MathF (F stands of Function) and use LISP syntax model.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
